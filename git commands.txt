1- go to your git account via browser and create a new repository : pic 1
2- set up your repo information : name ( required ) and discription ( optional , just for clrification ) and set visibility to others ( private or public ) : pic 2
3-click on create repo in the bottom 
4-make a folder on your computer to link the repo on git hub to your local repo in pc 

  inside the folder : make changes like add a new .txt file , call it whatever yo want 
  
  inside the folder : right click : open git bash , then :

  use the commands in the first commands jpg :
  
  git init

  git add .

  git commit -m "your message , exemple : first commit"

  you will have the master branch , you can choose to change it into main or whatever , lets change it to main : git branch -M main
  
  link your local repo to your remote repo with : git remote add origin (link to your repo , usually you'll find it like this "https://github.com/iman-yakoubi/Project-alpha.git" ) , we will use this example : git remote add origin https://github.com/iman-yakoubi/Project-alpha.git
  
  finally , git push -u origin ( your branch , here we have main : git push -u origin main
  

you've finished setting up the git repo the first time ... 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

already existing repo : you can use the same first commands jpg 
or .
use git clone : pic 3 - pic 4

then go into the folder and git bash there ; you'll be in the project 

git bash there  

choose a branche : 

git checkout (  existing branche ) : git checkout existing-branche
or
git checkout -b ( new branche ) : git checkout -b new-branche

do your work and then : 

git status 

git add .

git commit -m " your message "

git push origin (your branch , here it's the one you chose earlier , let's say new-branche ) : git push origin new-branche
